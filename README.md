# auth_require_group_membership
RoundCube plugin for LDAP authentication with group membership requirement

I have RC installation with 2 interfaces: intranet http for all users and public https, and IMAP LDAP authentication
This plugin allows you grant access for all valid user from witihn local network and require user to be a member of security group 
to access mail outside company

All parameters in config files is self-explanatory
